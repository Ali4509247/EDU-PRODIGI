### Q1: What are you planning to build?

ANSWER:

We are planning to build a social network akin to a mix between a web forum and LinkedIn directly catered to students, focusing on academic and vocational peer-to-peer support. This will allow students to connect easily and quickly to other students with common interests along with similar academic goals and skills. There are plenty of students on campus in need of assistance, whether it be with coursework, projects, connections to help improve their network, and more. As such, our platform aims to connect these students in need with more experienced students and/or alumni, who are willing to help out, whether that be due to altruism, financial remuneration, or any other reason. Given the campus does not have a hub for communication between students/alumni that is well known or easily accessible, we aim to bridge that gap with a website that is intuitive to navigate.

### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

ANSWER:

Since this website focuses mainly on peer help, this app's target users will be students. However, students could have different demographics, such as age, gender, occupation, and income. We can divide the age into first-year, final-year, and other students. They could be between 19 and 26 years old. We mainly separate first-year and final-year students from other students because this website can provide social networking for the first-year and provide career mentors to the final year. Therefore, we emphasize this range of people. In terms of gender, this website should be friendly to any gender, not limited to men, females, and LGBTQ+. Occupation mainly focuses on students but also includes students who may have a job. So, this website is open to any incoming type of students. We have provided more specific examples of our persona below.


1) Kevin:
   - 1st year, male, undergrad, needs help with academics and prefers visual/video learning. Not native English speaker, thus requires UI to be intuitive.

2) Rachel:
    - 4th year, female, undergraduate, native english speaker. She need some career advice, and helpers for the project she is working on. Can provide help with academics.

3) Eddy:
   - 2nd yr, LGBTQ+, undergrad needs help with academics, can help with 1st yr academics. Wants to get a head start on filling out their resume; looking for a project to take part in.

### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

ANSWER:

Scenario 1:  Andy Part
A user may choose our product to find a new friend or learn a different culture if they are not a domestic student. Based on our response to question 2, we have provided some personas, and one which suits this example is Kevin. Kevin is an international student. This is his first time coming to Canada. He can use this website to solve the issue of Social Networking. He can find a Japanese student in Ontario, and even a Japanese student at the same university. As such, he won't feel lonely. In the meantime, he may also find Canadian Born Japanese at the same university on this website. So, he has a mentor to tell him about the cultural differences and improve his English by mainly using English in discussions and Japanese as support. In this case, Kevin can spend less time learning English and the differences in cultural behavior. Thus, he can put his rest of time on studying his UX/UI design.

Scenario 2:  Eddy Part
For more general use cases, when searching for academic aid, a user can find people from the same campus as them to help, which allows for advice tailored to the courses they’re taking and the professors they know. This also facilitates the creation of projects and events for in person participation. Given that modern communication platforms are more general use, our platform is focused on academia and career progression. It cuts out the noise and distractions, and even pre-categorizes projects, academia, and more, thus making it easier to find collaborators you are looking for.

Scenario 3: Rachel
For an upper year student the platform will be a good resource as they will be provided with quick access to other students who have common interests and knowledge bases. Consider the user Rachel mentioned in part 2. Rachel seeks career advice, the career section will allow many users to post/ask questions, notably this will allow people with more experience to respond. Similarly Rachel can aid others in academics as she is more advanced in the years, this may be a good resource for her as demonstrating teaching abilities it may be beneficial to her resume.

### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 

ANSWER:

We defined a user story to be completed if
1) The feature works as intended
2) The feature is not breakable and is tested
3) The feature has documented code
4) The feature’s code is simple and easy to maintain

Throughout our meetings some of the key insights on how we would develop included:
Generating the ideas then discussing with the founder on the current approach then revisiting the user stories and adjusting
We decided to use Express.Js for the back end and React for the front end
One of the main decisions was whether we would work with a founder or not, we decided to work with one as it would give us a framework on the general ideas and allow us to hopefully develop quickly in the earlier stages
  
We will be organizing into front end and back end developers for each of the user stories, in terms of tools will be using Jira, Slack and Discord as main methods of communication and organization. We will be meeting 2 times a week Fridays along with briefly discussing ideas and workloads after the lecture on Tuesdays.
