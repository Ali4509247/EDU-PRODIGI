## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

* **When**: 2024-07-05
* **Where**: Discord

## Process - Reflection

The sprint overall went well with substantial discussion and collaboration on completing the sprint content.

### Decisions that Turned Out Well

Process-related decisions that were successful:

1. The addition of extra discussions between standups allowed us to clarify ideas and concepts, keeping everyone on task.
2. Using bugs in the Jira board helped us catch logic and runtime errors effectively.
3. We supported each other by sharing workloads during midterms and heavy assignment periods.

### Decisions that Did Not Turn Out as Well as Hoped

Process-related decisions that were less successful:

1. The tasks section on the Jira board was underutilized.
2. Many meetings ran longer than expected. While this increased awareness of the project's current state, it also detracted from time available for studying and completing other tasks.

### Planned Changes

1. We intended to add project cards, user cards, and post cards into the search bar. This addition mid-sprint was overly ambitious, resulting in only the post cards being completed while user and project cards were not.

## Product - Review

### Goals and/or Tasks that Were Met/Completed

1. **Friends List**
   - Implemented the ability to add and remove friends/followers.
2. **Calendar**
   - Implemented the ability to add and remove events with notifications.
3. **Posts Page**
   - Implemented the ability to add comments and likes to posts.

### Goals and/or Tasks that Were Planned but Not Met/Completed

1. We planned to add project cards, user cards, and post cards into the search bar. However, this was an overestimation of our capacity, and only the post cards were completed.

## Meeting Highlights

Key insights for the next iteration:

1. The addition of extra meetings and bug tracking allowed us to stay informed about the project's current state.
2. Clarification meetings helped us understand high-level concepts in the code.
3. Distributing tasks based on their difficulty and considering each team member's current workload helped reduce stress and improve efficiency.
